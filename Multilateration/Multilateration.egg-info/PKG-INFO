Description: # Localization
        
        ## Introduction
        
        This library is based out of [kamalshadi/Localization](https://github.com/kamalshadi/Localization).
        
        This fork has the same 2D/3D implementations but aim (not done yet) to provide a 2.5D implementation with one or more axis fixed.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package has been tested with python2.7 and python3.6. Use pip to install the package:
        
        ```bash
        # required libraries:
        pip install numpy scipy
        pip install multilateration
        # or before being published on Pypi;
        sudo -H python setup.py install
        # or for development
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import multilateration
        from math import sqrt
        
        P=multilateration.Project(goal=[None, None, 2.0]) # To fix that the resulting height should be 2 meters
        # P=multilateration.Project() # for 3D, simply do not set a goal
        P.add_anchor('anchor_A',(1,0,1))
        P.add_anchor('anchor_B',(-1,0,1))
        P.add_anchor('anchor_C',(1,1,1))
        
        P.add_measure_id('anchor_A',sqrt(2))
        P.add_measure_id('anchor_B',sqrt(2))
        P.add_measure_id('anchor_C',sqrt(3))
        print(P.solve())
        ```
        
        ## Changes from the [original library](https://github.com/kamalshadi/Localization)
        
        The library has been cleaned:
        
        - Remove unused dependencies
        - Keep only the LSE method
        - Removed all models and changed the usage. It will only be in 3D, with values we can fix with the goal, to allow 2.5D.
